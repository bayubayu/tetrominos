# Tetrominos

This is tetris clone using javascript. My favourite classic game. 

I tried to separate game logic (as plain JS) and UI (html+jquery). There's simple unit testing too.

Demo here

Also learned a bit about webpack tooling too. So the stack are:

* Simple npm script for task runner
* Webpack for bundler
* Mocha for test runner, chai as assertion
* sass for styling
* jquery for UI

So far it already covering basic tetris game mechanic with keyboard controls. I will continue it when i got a chance, eg: add scoring etc.


Enjoy.
